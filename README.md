# React boxes
A new app developed with React (React Native also coming).

## About
This app can create boxes and inside each box you can include any sort of file.

## Features
Built with NodeJs and React. Next step is to add a mobile support with React Native.
It uses MongoDB Atlas to persist boxes and files and it is deployed on Heroku (both backend and frontend).
